# [](#header-1)About

This was made for server administrative control and to aid clan control. It comes with a bunch of ready admin commands for your enjoyment and security system to prevent crashing. It is very similar to Makermod & JA+ due to the ability to place objects and FX on any given map and the function to use emotions, admin commands, and along the lines everything else. It comes with 5 levels of admin powers for your clan if your into that sorta thing. Each with its own password protection and simple tool to customize the selection of admin powers for each.

Everything is edited by the server.cfg file in its folder ClanMod along with other changable settings such as, Custom messages, Server name, force enable/disable.
